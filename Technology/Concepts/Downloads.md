## Mirror

It is an exact copy of another server's files (like a reflection).

## Magneti(ic) Link

It is used for peer-to-peer downloads. So instead of pointing to a specific server or file location, it contains a unique hash of the file. Torrent client uses that "magnetic fingerprint" to find peers (other computers) who already have the file.
