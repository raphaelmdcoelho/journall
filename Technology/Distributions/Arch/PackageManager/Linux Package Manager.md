Linux work with a collection of software packages stored on servers, plus metadata describing them.

A repository contains:
* Compiled package files (.pkg.tar.zst)
* Metadata about each package
Examples of repositories:
* core, extra, multilib, community...

There is a file to configure it: `/etc/pacman.conf`.
