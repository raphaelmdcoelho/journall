A terminal is a program (the window) that lets you interact with a shell.

A **terminal emulates** the old physical terminals used to interact with mainframes.

The terminal itself does NOT understand commands.

Examples:

* Windows Terminal
* Command Prompt
* PowerShell Terminal
* mcOS Terminal
* GNOME Terminal
* Konsole
* xterm
